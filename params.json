Ready for initial public release.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nVisit http://seanbuscay.github.io/rush/html/ to view full project documentation.\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\nRun a Drush Rush command like:\r\n\r\n    drush rush myjob.init\r\n\r\nTo parse the job folder's rush files for build parameters and build operations and then execute the following operations:\r\n\r\n1. Make the build directory\r\n2. Put the directory in the web root\r\n3. Add other directories and files to the build (setup the build skeleton)\r\n4. Create a docroot folder for the Drupal code base\r\n5. Build the code base with Drush Make using specified makefile(s) and prepare the site for install\r\n6. Create the specified database\r\n7. Create the specified dns and virtual host entries\r\n8. Run any pre-build commands\r\n9. Run any pre-build scripts\r\n10. Create build aliases.drushrc.php files\r\n11. Install the site\r\n12. Change variable values as specified\r\n13. Run any post-build commands\r\n14. Run any post-build scripts\r\n15. Put the build under version control\r\n16. Create a remote repo (such as on GITHUB), commit the code, and push it\r\n\r\n## Quick Start Install\r\n\r\n*Assuming you already have Drush installed*\r\n\r\n    cd ~\r\n    git clone git@github.com:seanbuscay/rush.git .drush/rush\r\n    drush rush init\r\n\r\nAfter install, run the following:\r\n\r\n    drush rush helloworld\r\n\r\nYou should see the message `Hello World` in your terminal.\r\n\r\nSee the [Install Guide](http://seanbuscay.github.io/rush/html/doc-install-guide.html) for further detail, dependencies, and requirements.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis project originates out of experience using Jenkins to automate building and testing Drupal projects.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Jenkins is an extendable open source continuous integration server.  Visit: http://jenkins-ci.org/ for more information.\r\n\r\nBeyond its excellent tool set to execute and monitor the results of repeated build jobs, Jenkins is a good tool to automate repetitive workflows for developers.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a developer needs to work on a website locally, he or she typically must:\r\n\r\n1. Get the code via a Versions Control System like git\r\n2. Switch to a branch or tag to work on\r\n3. Change or add some parameters in settings files to match the development environment\r\n4. Get the db export\r\n5. Create a testing db\r\n6. Import the db snapshot\r\n7. Create a local host file entry\r\n8. Restart Apache\r\n\r\nThat's eight steps before starting to code.\r\n\r\nJenkins can automate many of these common developer workflows, using job parameters to let developers simply enter a project name and a branch and then run a Jenkins job to do their repetitive build work for them.\r\n\r\nLike Jenkins, Drush Rush is a tool to run parameterized builds with Drush.\r\nIn most cases the build jobs are a series of core drush commands chained together to complete a full build process with a single command.\r\n\r\n### A Few Points about Drush Rush Jobs\r\n\r\n1.  Drush Rush jobs are **written once then used repeatedly**. *There is probably little value to writing a Drush Rush job for a one time build process.*\r\n2.  Drush Rush jobs are **extendable**.  Complex jobs may be written by extending and or combining similar jobs.\r\n3.  Drush Rush jobs are **shareable** so a job written by one developer may be shared with many.\r\n4.  Drush Rush jobs are **light weight**.  Drush Rush may be used to execute steps as part of a continuous integration or automated testing process, however, it is not a CI or Testing Suite.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tested Platforms\r\n\r\n1. Tested and working with a standard LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 12.x\r\n2. Tested and working on Mac OSX Mountain Lion AMP Stack defined here: [OSX AMP](http://coolestguyplanettech.com/downtown/install-and-configure-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-osx-108-mountain-lion)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
